                    <b>SharperTool</b> is the parent company for <a href="http://gardenbuzz.com" target="_blank"><b>GardenBuzz</b></a>
                    and <a href="http://tennisblock.com" target="_blank"><b>Tennisblock.com</b></a>.
                    These are two projects that we are currently working on, and we have more in the works.
                    We are a technical and creative group of developers, designers, and gardeners. We are active
                    in tennis, and other outdoor activities. We build what we use, which is why we are so
                    passionate about what we do.

                        We use the <b>Python</b> programming language and
                        <b>Django Web Framework</b> to build powerful,
                        flexible and exciting websites. Python and Django are a powerful
                        combination, and give us super flexibility, fast development times,
                        and many re-usable solutions so that we can build optimized solutions.

                        Javascript? You bet! AngularJS drives many of our
                        pages, along with other established client side tools.

                        ReactJS is a technology we are working with to make re-usable web
                        modules. We expect to use more and more of ReactJS and related tools
                        in the future.

                        We constantly evaluate new technologies and use them when
                        they are proven, stable, and ready for prime time. We do not
                        plan to fall behind the technology curve anytime soon.

                        Our server infrastructure is based on Amazon Web services. 
                        We know AWS well, and use it effectively.

                        On the backend we use MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
